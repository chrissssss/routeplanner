# routeplanner

A simple route planner software with a focus on bicycles written in Go (based on OpenStreetMap data).

Just putting the source code online for those of you who are interested in basic techniques. My approach is far from complete or ready for being used in production.

I put up a **demo page** for the Berlin/Germany area: http://route.florian-schlachter.de

## Features

 * Route calculation specifically for *cars* and *bicycles*.
 * ... TBD
